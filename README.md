The Dwarf Community Art Collection.
Part of Roadmap Phase 1 - Admire the Art

- Each NFT(ERC-1155) is an exclusive 1/1 donated by a community member.
- The Dwarf team gets the final say of what makes it into the collection.
- These NFTs are not to be sold, they are to be given away as part of parties, contests, or roadmap events.
- Any community member can contribute, and the Dwarf art is fair use.
- ONLY Dwarf Holders qualify to receive these NFTs!
- They will be extremely limited to start (given we have not yet sold out) so as not to dilute the main collection.
